# Requirements

This package requires Python 3, setuptools and pip3 for installation.
We will provide eventually a pip installable version.

# Installation

Clone this repo and go into its directory, then execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf
cd sccaf
# you might want to create a virtualenv for SCCAF before installing
pip3 install .
```

if your python environment is configured for python 3, then you should be able to replace python3 for just python (although pip3 needs to be kept). In time this will be simplified by a simple pip call.
